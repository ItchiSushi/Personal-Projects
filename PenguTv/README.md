<h1>PenguTv 🐧</h1>

<p align = "justify">This is an Android Studio mobile application that I created in 2022. This application was used as an anime list app that allowed users to add all the different anime that they watched onto the app and will be added to the list that they had. This made use a mySQLite database which is a free offline database application. Users were able to rate, view, add, remove and update data on the app. They also had access to their own profiles by means of login and register options which gave them the freedom to manage their own lists.</p>
