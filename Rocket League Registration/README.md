<h1>Rocket League Registration ðŸš—</h1>

<p>This is a registration application that I created using Android Studio, Java, and XML. This application made use of CRUD functionality using SQLite database as the external database software. Users were able to sign-up for an upcoming tournament, in which they could withdraw their sign-up too. I created this application as part of a second-year final term project.</p>

<h2>Environment:</h2>

Android Studio
